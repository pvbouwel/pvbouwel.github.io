&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wanted to control the flow of packets for specific processes on my Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) such that they won&amp;rsquo;t go through a tunnel device which is setup for VPN connectivity. The VPN software is provided as is and I do not administer its configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that this post assumes you have understanding of network routing and are equiped to troubleshoot problems. If not you should first learn how networks work first. Each network setup has its own specifics. Appliance vendors come up with defaults and automation for the most common scenarios. Custom configuration can conflict with that and might isolate you from network access. All responsibilities remain those of the reader.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
